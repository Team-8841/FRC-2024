This repo contains the code we're writing for the 2024 FRC game and season: [Crescendo](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/game-and-season). I'm not really sure what to write here tbh. Trans rights are human rights.

## Documentation

To generate the javadocs run `./gradlew generateDocs` in the root directory of the project. The generated documentation should be put into `build/docs`.
